### Objectives of this project: 

- Calculate the cumulative price (in U.S. dollars) of cargo each destintation port has transported through the given period.
- Calculate the most expensive and least expensive cargo transported through each destination port.
- Visualize the amount of sales and amount of cargo per day per each destination port
- Visualize top 10 items per port

- The destination port of **Tianjin** has received the largest U.S. dollar amount of cargo at roughly **$247 trillion dollars in 17 days.** The destination port of **Shanghai** has received the least amount of cargo based on it's U.S.. dollar amount at roughly **2 trillion dollars**.
- The **most expensive item** transpoted through all the ports were **sports cars**. While the **least expensive item** transported through all the destination ports were a **can of beans**.
